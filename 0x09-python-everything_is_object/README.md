# Everything is object
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Software Engineering School**. It aims to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), mutability, identity and data types in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.8.5
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

All `.txt` files store the answers to the questions asked by Holberton staff.
